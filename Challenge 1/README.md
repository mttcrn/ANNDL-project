# ANNDL First Homework
In this folder are contained all the notebooks developed for the first challenge

## Deliverables
- Includes the final models submitted for evaluation.
- Contains the report summarizing the challenge, methodologies, and results.
## Experiments
It contains some notebooks developed during the challenge, in which we "experimented" different techniques:
### Preprocessing
- Details all the preprocessing steps applied to the initial dataset.
### GAP & Augmentation
- Contains a notebook with a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) designed from scratch as a baseline.
### TL model tested
- Contains notebooks used to evaluate the performance of pre-trained architectures: `ConvNextBase`, `DenseNet121`, `InceptionV3` and `VGG16`.
### DenseNet121
- Notebooks on transfer learning applied to `DenseNet121`, experimenting with augmentations, regularization, and callback techniques to optimize performance.
